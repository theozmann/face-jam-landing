Hello!

This is just a simple landing page dedicated to the FaceJam podcast. 
I'm using this project to solidify some foundational html and css skills.

I do not claim ownership to any of the pictures or content 
linked to on this website. This is a non-published personal project used
only for html and css practice. The name "Face Jam", the pictures used,
